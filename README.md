# AI Letter Site (Steps 1-3)

This is a Next.js project implementing Steps 1-3 (Intro carousel, Language select, Actor select) for the AI Letter Generator UI.

## Run locally

1. Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

2. Start dev server:

## Notes

- Actor images are placeholders in `public/` and can be replaced.
- Video/voice generation is not included yet â€” this repo provides the UI flow (Steps 1-3).
